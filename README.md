## hp-wmi manual fan + keyboard RGB control

This is an Initial module for manual fan control and keyboard RGB for devices that support it. Single‑zone RGB works now; I plan to add 4‑zone but I need testers.

### Installation:

Dkms:
```
git clone https://github.com/Vilez0/hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control
cd hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control
make
sudo make install-dkms
```

Arch package:
```
git clone https://github.com/Vilez0/hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control
cd hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control
make install-arch
```

or if you just want to test the module (not permanent):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vilez0/hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control
cd hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control/
make
sudo rmmod hp-wmi
sudo modprobe led_class_multicolor
sudo insmod hp-wmi.ko
```

### Usage 
- Keyboard (single‑zone RGB): control under `/sys/class/leds/hp::kbd_backlight`.
  - Use the multicolor interface attribute `multi_intensity` which accepts `R G B` (0–255 each).
  - Example:
    ```bash
    echo "255 0 0" | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/hp::kbd_backlight/multi_intensity # Set to red
    echo 128 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/hp::kbd_backlight/brightness # Change brightness to 50% (0-255)
    ```

- Fans: control via `fanX_target` files (check fanX_max for the max values. Anything above the max values will return -EINVAL).
    ```bash
    echo 5500 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/hwmon/hwmon*/fan1_target  # will set fan1 to 5500 rpm
    echo 5200 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/hwmon/hwmon*/fan2_target # will set fan2 to 5200 rpm
    ```

- Fn+P Shortcut: On laptops that support it, the Fn+P shortcut for switching performance profiles should work OOTB. You can verify if its working by monitoring the `/sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile` file.

### Tested on:
- Victus 16‑s1 (9Z791EA) — tested by me.
- I need testers to report which models it works on or not. see https://github.com/Vilez0/hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control/issues/1
